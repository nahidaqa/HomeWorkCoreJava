/*Create a package name "hw2JavaBasics" [create it by the help of header, not by right click of src file] inside the Homework project created before. Create a Class "MyCar" from the header (not by right click of package, this is the other way to create class). Under main method I expect the first outcome will be ---- My name is <your name with double quotation>, I love to drive, My car info is below: . Use String concatenation feature for above outcome. Now use other syso to print your car each info (color, model, year, wheel drive [example:4WD] etc. [you can add more if you want]) in a separate line [try to follow how to copy and paste a line in IDE by key board command]. Use print instead of println for the car feature when print, use \n and \t at least once anywhere in the class. organize code at the end (very important),  After completing the code, paste it below.s

public class MyCar {
